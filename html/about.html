                I am currently an Information Security Engineer with Verizon Communications working on a software development team with the primary focus being the development of our Identity Governance platform and data ingestion into one of our datalakes.
                <br>I do mostly software engineering along with vulnerbaliity management and a little bit of database administration/development. I thoroughly enjoy software engineering and I plan to continue to pursue it for the long term. Professionally, I do most of my development work in .NET Core, .NET Framework, SQL Server, and Powershell.
                <br>In my personal projects I tend to use more Java or Python so I can stay a well rounded developer. In my personal time I like to branch out and explore new technologies to expand my toolset. For example, I have explored Rust and I created this website in order to further my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to learn the basic web development stack. I have a Raspberry PI I setup as a file server and PI Hole. I also built a home server and installed Ubuntu Server as the OS to force myself to get more comfortable with and learn Linux and the command line.
                <br>Building computers is another hobby of mine that I thoroughly enjoy to do and keep up with the community. I have been building computers and programming since I was 15. I have build over 10 computers including for myself and family/friends.  
                <br>I studied Management Information Systems at Texas A&M Univeristy with a minor in Cyber Security. I graduated in December 2020. During my undergraduate I focused my coursework around Software Engineering.
                <br>In my free time I enjoy working on personal IT projects, fishing, video games, and finding the best ramen in the DFW metroplex!
